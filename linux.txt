 * INTRODUCTION TO LINUX
 - Linux is a free and open source Operating system based on the linux kernel. Linux is basically 
   packaged in a distro. It was the first multiuser & multitasking operating system in the world.
 - Importance of usin Linux as an OS is that it has the best price/performance ratio, it is 
   reliable, eco-friendly, ubiquitious and most of scientific softwares are developed in it.
 - Linux is made of 4 components. First, the human-machine interface like the input devices
   like keyboard, mouse, display, sound, etc. Second is the hardware which includes supercomputer,
   desktop, mobile, etc. Third is Linux Kernel or the link between the hardware & software. Last
   is the software which is the pool of free and open source and propietary softwares. It includes
   GUI(desktop UI, touch Ui, wearable UI), image processing, dtp, graphics,etc. 
 - Linux distributions or linux distros is the different varities or distributions of linux kernel
   acc to the need of the user rannging from pcs to supercomputers. Ubuntu is a popular Linux 
   distro. They are of two types: generic distros(used generally) and task-specific distros(for a 
   specific task). Examples of generic distro are Redhat based(Fedora, Centos, Scientific Linux)
   and Debian based(Debian, Ubuntu). Some task specific distros are Biolinux, Bioslax. 
 - Linux can be approached either by Graphical User Interface(GNOME, KDE) like windows, mac,
   tablet or by Command line Interface using terminal, powershell, etc.
 - Basic syntax of all commands in CLI : command argument1 argument2 .... . Command is the basic 
   work we wish to execute. All these are commands are case sensitive n mostly in lowercase. 
 - Collection of variables collectively is called shell environment. It controls issues like 
   appearance of shell prompt(indicates when system is ready to execute commands n give useful 
   info), default text editor, etc. One of those variables is the execution path which is a list 
   of dir that shell remembers, in order to automatically refer certain apps. Command for this is
   echo $PATH to see list of dirs.
 - Directory(dir) is a group of files or folders. They have a heirarical order termed as path.
 - pwd: Print your Working Dir ( to see your current directory), we can go to home dir by ~.
   We can go to a dir under home dir by : ~/dir_name $
 - cd: change directory(to move around file system). cd.. is used to go one step up(back).
 - ls: is to display all dir contents(equal to dir is msdos). ls-la: displays contets with details 
   like size, permissions, etc. 
 - find: to find a file in a dir. Syntax: find[start pt] -name file_name -print. Here, start pt is
   from where u want to start the search. 
 - Each file or a folder has a set of permission flags that define in a strict way, different 
   actions that can be performed on it. For a file -rwx--- and for a dir drwx---- where r-readable
   w-modifying and x-executable d-shows that it is dir.
 - chmod: used to change permissions of a file or dir. Syntax: chmod [ u|g|o (+|-) (r,w,x)] [fname]
   this is general synatax of chmod.
 - chmod u+(-)w file_name to change mode to add writing from read only mode and vice versa.
 - chmod u+(-)x is for running or executing a program or removing it. It is used everytime before
   using the program.
 - In case of dir u+rx is used to access the dir.
 - rm: used to del a file
 - cat: to view contents of a file. if u see contents in bin form Use strings command. if file is
   too big, we use less command to stop when screen is filled. more command used for same.
 - head and tail command to display beggning n end of file. head-3 displays 3 lines.
 - mkdir: used to create dir
 - rmdir: used to remove dir(if empty)
 - rm -r -f: remove a dir (not empty). -r for del dir recursively and -f for going ahead to del.
 - cp: used to copy a file. Syntax: cp old_name location/new_name. 
 - cp -p -r: used to copy dir. Syntax: cp -p -r oldname/ newname/. -p for permission and -r for
   copying recursively.
 - mv: used to move or rename a file. mv oldname newname renames a file. mv oldname location 
   moves a file. mv oldname location/newname moves with renaming.
